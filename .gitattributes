# Per-repository settings, manage how Git reads line endings
# http://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes
# https://rehansaeed.com/gitattributes-best-practices/

# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
*       text=auto

#
# The above will handle all files NOT found below
#

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout.

xmonad-contrib needs to be installed as well.

- It gives you 12 workspaces per screen, available through Alt+F1..F12.
- You can move windows to a workspace with Win+F1..F12.
- You can do both at the same time by pressing Win+Alt+F1..F12.
- All workspaces except F11 respect panels and docks.
- F11 is the fullscreen workspace (for mplayer, etc.).
- F12 is the instant messaging workspace.
- When you switch screens the mouse will go with you.

Keybindings mostly use the Super key, but some use Alt to mimic other window
managers. In general: Alt is used for navigation, Super for modification.
Some of the bindings resemble the XMonad defaults, but most don't.

Before we have the commands lets make some word definitions:
- window = The window that a program runs in.
- Workspace = One screen with many windows.
- Screen = A physical computer screen that you will look at.
